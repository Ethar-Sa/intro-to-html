    a graphic Design student at

    <p>
        My creativity comes from a mix of my diverse
    background and strong time management skills, which
    help me stay focused and organized. I’ve learned to
    enjoy even the toughest challenges because they push
    me to grow and improve as a designer. What I love
    most about graphic design is how
      <b>
        <blockquote>every designer has
    their own style,</blockquote>
      </b>
     and I’m excited to bring my own ideas
    and creativity to the industry
    </p>

    <p>I’m passionate about
    learning and can’t wait to see where this journey takes
    me.
